Easy Oatmeal Muffins

    1 cup milk
    1 cup quick cooking oats
    1 egg
    1/4 cup vegetable oil
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    1/4 cup white sugar
    2 teaspoons baking powder
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    Add all ingredients to list

    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
    In a small bowl, combine milk and oats; let soak for 15 minutes.
    In a separate bowl, beat together egg and oil; stir in oatmeal mixture. 
    In a third bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. 
    Stir flour mixture into wet ingredients, just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups until cups are 2/3 full.
    Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
