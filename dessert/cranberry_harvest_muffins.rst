Cranberry Harvest Muffins

3 cups all-purpose flour (1 cup multigrain, 2 cup all purpose)
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger (substitution: pumpkin pie spice)
1 1/4 cups whole milk
2 extra-large eggs
1/2 pound unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped fresh cranberries
1/2 cup pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1 cup brown sugar, packed

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.  Sift together the flour, baking powder,
baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and ginger in a large bowl.  Make a well in the
center of the mixture and add the milk, eggs, and melted butter.  Stir quickly
just to combine.  Add the cranberries, figs, hazelnuts, and both sugars and
stir just to distribute the fruits, nuts, and sugar evenly throughout the
batter.

Spoon the batter into the paper liners, filling each one to the top.  Bake for
20 to 25 minutes, until browned on the top and a toothpick inserted in the
center of the muffins comes out clean.
