SUNNY APPLE CRISP

Topping:
4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1/2 cup packed light-brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

4 apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Vanilla ice cream or heavy cream, for serving (optional)


Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter an 8-inch square baking dish.
For topping, combine the butter, sugar, flour, oats and cinnamon in a bowl. Work together with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal. Toss in nuts; set aside.
Toss the apples with lemon juice and spoon into the baking dish. Sprinkle topping evenly over the apples. Bake in center of the oven for 1 hour or until bubbly and the apples are tender. Let cool slightly. Serve warm, topped with ice cream or cream, if desired.

Makes 6 servings.
