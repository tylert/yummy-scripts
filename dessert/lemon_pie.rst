Lemon Meringue Pie

* 1 nine-inch, pricked, baked pastry shell
* 2/3 cup granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 3 tbsp cornstarch
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cups hot water
* 3 eggs, separated
* 2 lemons (grate rind, then extract 6 tbsp juice)
* 2 tsp butter
* 6 tbsp granulated sugar

In a saucepan, combine the 2/3 cup sugar, flour, cornstarch and salt, then
stir in the hot water.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
thick and transparent, about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  In a bowl,
blend the yolks, then whisk half the sugar mixture into the yolks and pour it
back into the saucepan.  Return it to the heat and whisk constantly until the
mixture thickens, without boiling.  Add the lemon juice, grated rind and
butter.  Set the hot saucepan in a bowl of cold water to cool the mixture,
about 5 minutes.  Pour the filling into the baked pastry shell.

To make the meringue, whisk egg whites on medium speed in an electric mixer,
or by hand with a balloon whisk, until soft peaks form.  Slowly sprinkle in
the 6 tbsp sugar, a spoonful at a time, while beating, until the meringue is
stiff and shiny.  Spread the meringue over the warm filling without leaving
any lemon mixture exposed, mounding in the centre.  Use the back of a spoon to
make small peaks in the meringue like a rough sea.  Bake the pie in a
preheated 375-degree F oven until golden, for about 8 minutes.  Watch the pie
closely so the meringue doesn't overcook, causing unwanted beads of moisture
to form.  Cool pie for 15 minutes before serving.
