Preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour a 9 × 5 loaf pan. In a large bowl,
combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  In a medium bowl, combine
eggs, sugar, butter, vanilla extract, lemon extract and lemon juice with a
mixer until blended.

Pour wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and blend until smooth. Add oil
and lemon zest and mix well. Pour into loaf pan and bake for 45 minutes until
toothpick comes out clean. (It took an hour in my oven). Remove from oven and
pour glaze over it, then cool in pan on a rack. Glaze – whisk to combine
