Thick N' Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

2 1/4 cups of all purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup of butter
1 tsp salt (if using unsalted butter)
1 cup of packed brown sugar
1/2 cup of granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
2 eggs
2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips


Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cream together your butter and sugar until it is light and fluffy. Add in the eggs and vanilla, mixing thoroughly. Beat in the flour, baking soda and salt.
When that is done, fold in the two cups of chocolate chips by hand, and prepare to put them on some parchment paper lined cookie sheets.
Drop by rounded teaspoonful onto the baking sheets.
Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown and slightly underdone.
Cool on the sheets completely.
