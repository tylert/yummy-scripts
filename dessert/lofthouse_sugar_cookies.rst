Lofthouse Sugar Cookies

Cookies:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
2 eggs
3/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon almond extract, optional
1/4 teaspoon salt

Frosting:
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
3 cups powdered sugar
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, optional
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2-3 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream
food coloring, if desired
sprinkles, garnish


Preheat oven to 425ยบ F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt until combined. Set aside.
In a large bowl or mixer, cream together butter and sugar for 3-5 minutes, or until fluffy and lightened in color. Scrape down sides as needed.
One at a time, beat in eggs, then mix in sour cream and vanilla extract.
Gradually mix in the dry ingredients until just incorporated.
Divide cookie dough in half and transfer to 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Wrap tightly and refrigerate or freeze until firm and chilled.
Roll dough out to 1/4-inch thickness and use a cookie cutter to form cookies, or scoop dough into 2-inch balls and use a flat-bottomed drinking glass to gently flatten.
Transfer cookies to baking sheet and place in oven. Bake for 6-8 minutes, or until pale golden on the bottom. Do not overbake.
Remove cookies from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
Start frosting by creaming together butter, vegetable shortening (if using), powdered sugar and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.
Working with 1 tablespoon at a time, gradually whisk in milk or heavy cream until desired consistency is reached.
Add food coloring, then frost cooled cookies, adding sprinkles if desired. Let frosting set and enjoy!
