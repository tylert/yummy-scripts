Lofthouse Sugar Cookies

Cookies:

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 cup sour cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, optional
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

Frosting:

* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 3 cups powdered sugar
* 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, optional
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2-3 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream
* food coloring, if desired
* sprinkles, garnish


Preheat oven to 425º F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt
until combined. Set aside.

In a large bowl or mixer, cream together butter and sugar for 3-5 minutes, or
until fluffy and lightened in color. Scrape down sides as needed.

One at a time, beat in eggs, then mix in sour cream and vanilla extract.

Gradually mix in the dry ingredients until just incorporated.

Divide cookie dough in half and transfer to 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Wrap
tightly and refrigerate or freeze until firm and chilled.

Roll dough out to 1/4-inch thickness and use a cookie cutter to form cookies,
or scoop dough into 2-inch balls and use a flat-bottomed drinking glass to
gently flatten.

Transfer cookies to baking sheet and place in oven. Bake for 6-8 minutes, or
until pale golden on the bottom. Do not overbake.

Remove cookies from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Start frosting by creaming together butter, vegetable shortening (if using),
powdered sugar and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.

Working with 1 tablespoon at a time, gradually whisk in milk or heavy cream
until desired consistency is reached.

Add food coloring, then frost cooled cookies, adding sprinkles if desired. Let
frosting set and enjoy!
