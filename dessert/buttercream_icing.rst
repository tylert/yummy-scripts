Buttercream Icing
-----------------

* 1/2 cup shortening
* 1/2 cup of butter
* 1 tsp of vanilla
* 4 cups of confectioners' sugar
* 2 tbls of milk

In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening and vanilla. Blend in
the sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in milk
and continue mixing until light and fluffy. Keep icing covered until ready to
decorate.


I often will use a cup of butter instead of 1/2 and 1/2.

You can also add more milk to make it a bit thinner for some of the decorating
tips. Usually I add no more than 4 tbls of milk. I do this mainly if I am using
the grass tip.
