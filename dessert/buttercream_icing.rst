Buttercream Icing

1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup of butter
1 tsp of vanilla
4 cups of confectioners' sugar
2 tbls of milk

In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening and vanilla. Blend in
the sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in milk
and continue mixing until light and fluffy. Keep icing covered until ready to
decorate.

------------------------------

I often will use a cup of butter instead of 1/2 and 1/2.

You can also add more milk to make it a bit thinner for some of the decorating tips. Usually I add no more than 4 tbls of milk. I do this mainly if I am using the grass tip.
