Neapolitan Squares
------------------

Bottom & Middle
* 1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
* 1/2 cup  melted butter (or margarine)
* 1/2 cup  packed brown sugar
* 1/3 cup  all-pupose flour
* 2 cups medium-grind coconut (substitute dessicated or flaked)
* 1 can sweetened condensed milk
* a touch of milk

Combine first 4 ingredients and press into a 9" x 9" tinfoil-lined pan.  Bake
at 350F for 10 mins.

In a clean bowl, mix coconut and milk.  Spread over bottom layer.  Bake at 350F
for 20 mins. (or until slightly brown on edges).  Allow to cool before adding
frosting.

Top
* 2 cups icing sugar
* 1/4 cup  butter (around 4 tbsp.)
* red food colouring
* 1 teaspoon almond extract
* 2 teaspoons water

Beat together all ingredients adding water until thick.  Add 1 tsp. almond
extract.  Add red food colouring until pink.  Add frosting to bottom layers.

It is best to wait until the second or third day until cutting the squares.
Store airtight until ready to be cut.  Cut into 1/2" slices.  Serves millions.
