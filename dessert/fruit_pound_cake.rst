Fruit Pound Cake

3/4 cup softened butter
1/2 cup regular sugar
1/2 cup golden brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 eggs (lightly beaten)
1/4 cup milk
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour (sieved)
1 tsp baking powder
9 oz  fresh strawberries, mashed, or other fruit you wish to use

Preheat oven to 310 F. Grease or line your loaf pan.
Cream the butter and sugar until a pale light colour.
Add vanilla extract and slowly add the beaten eggs to the mixer, on a low speed setting, a bit at a time.
If the mixture starts to curdle or split, add a spoonful of your sieved flour, keep on adding the eggs, and a 
bit of flour if necessary, until all the eggs are added.
Add half the milk with half of the flour and the baking soda, keeping the mixer on a slow speed. 
Once combined, add the rest of the milk and flour. Right at the end, fold in the mashed strawberries
or whatever other fruit you wish to use.
Bake 1h 20-30 min.

Alternatives: don't mix in the berries, put half of batter in pan, layer blueberries, put last half of batter ontop.
Would probably also work with chopped apples and cinnamon.
