Microwave Lemon Curd
--------------------

* 1 cup white sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup fresh lemon juice (about 4-5 lemons)
* zest of 3 lemons
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted


In a large microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs until smooth
and thoroughly combined. Whisk in lemon juice, lemon zest and butter.

Cook in the microwave on full power for one minute intervals, stirring after
each minute. This process will take about 3-5 minutes depending on the strength
of your microwave. You will know the lemon curd is done cooking when it coats
the back of a metal spoon.

Remove from the microwave, push through a fine, mesh sieve and pour into
sterile jar.

Notes:
Store lemon curd in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
