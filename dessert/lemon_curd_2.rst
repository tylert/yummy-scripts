Lemon Curd
----------

* 3 large eggs
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
* 1/4 cup butter, cubed
* 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest

In a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, whisk eggs, sugar and lemon juice
until blended. Add butter and lemon zest; cook, whisking constantly, until
mixture is thickened and coats the back of a metal spoon. Transfer to a small
bowl; cool 10 minutes. Refrigerate, covered, until cold.
