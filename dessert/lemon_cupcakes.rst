Lemon Cupcakes with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting
-----------------------------------------------

Cupcakes
* 1 1/4 cups cake flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup whole milk

Frosting
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon peel
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups powdered sugar

Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
Line 12 muffin tin cups with paper cupcake liners.
Make the cupcakes. Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl and set aside.

In a large bowl and using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter
and sugar until smoothly blended and lightened in color, about 2 minutes. Stop
the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl as needed during mixing.

Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until each is blended into the batter and it
looks creamy, about 1 minute.

Add the lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla and beat for 2 minutes. If the
eggs are cold, the mixture may look slightly curdled.

On low speed and in 3 additions (3 flour, 2 milk), add the flour mixture and
milk alternately, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix just until
the flour is incorporated and the batter looks smooth.

Fill each paper liner with 1/4 cup of batter (an ice-cream scoop works well),
to about 1/2 inch below the top of the liner.

Bake just until the tops feel firm and a toothpick inserted in the center comes
out clean, about 23 minutes.

Cool the cupcakes for 10 minutes in the pan on a wire rack. Remove the cupcakes
from the pan onto a wire rack and let cool completely.

Make the frosting. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on low speed, beat
the butter, cream cheese, grated lemon peel, and vanilla until smooth and
thoroughly blended, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the
bowl as needed during mixing.

Add the powdered sugar, mixing until smooth, about 1 minute, then beat on
medium speed for 1 minute to lighten the frosting further. Use a small spatula
to spread about 3 tablespoons of frosting over the top of each cupcake.
