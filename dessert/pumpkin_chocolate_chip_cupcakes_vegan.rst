Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cupcakes w/Cinnamon Glaze

1 cup canned pumpkin
2 Tbsp canola oil
2 heaping Tbsp unsweetened applesauce
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup soymilk
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup mini chocolate chips

For the glaze:
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
2 Tbsp Earth Balance, melted
1 Tbsp soymilk
1/2 tsp vanilla

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Line a 12-cup muffin tin or a 24-cup mini muffin tin with paper liners and mist
lightly with cooking spray.  In a medium bowl, combine the pumpkin, oil,
applesauce, sugar, soymilk, and vanilla.  Sift in the flour, baking powder,
baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.  Gently mix together with a whisk, fork, or
spatula. Once combined, fold in the chocolate chips.

Fill muffin cups 2/3 full.  Bake for 22-24 minutes for regular cupcakes, or
16-18 minutes for minis. When done, let sit in the pan for a few minutes, then
transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Meanwhile, make the glaze.  In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar and
cinnamon. Add the margarine, soymilk, and vanilla and whisk until smooth.  Add
more powdered sugar, a spoonful at a time, if it looks too thin.  Keep at room
temperature until ready to use.

Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, use a spoon, ziploc bag with the
corner snipped, pastry bag, or fancy frosting piper like mine to drizzle on the
glaze.
