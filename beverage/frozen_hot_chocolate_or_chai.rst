Frozen Hot Chocolate or Frozen Chai

* 2 tbsp powdered hot chocolate or powdered chai
* 200 mL of milk or milk substitute (e.g.:  almond milk)

Throw everything into a "good" blender.
Run it on low to chop up the ice cubes.
Run it on high for a bit to blend the ice chunk slurry a bit finer.
Pour into a glass and enjoy.
