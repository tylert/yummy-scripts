In order to make soy milk, you need two cups of soy beans and six cups of
water to start.  Put the beans and water in a large bowl and let them soak
for twelve hours or so--the beans should be doubled in size.  Discard the
water.

Take a cup of soaked beans and three cups of fresh water.  Put them in a
blender and blend them down to a smooth paste.  Make a pouch out of three
layers of cheesecloth and put the paste in it.  Repeat for the other half of
the beans.

Wring the paste dry; collect all the drippings.  Put another five cups of
water into the paste and wring it again.  Throw the paste away.  Bring the
juice to a vigourous boil over medium heat, let it cool, and you've got fresh
soy milk.

To make tofu, dissolve a quarter cup of vinegar in a cup of water.  Take the
soy milk just as you get it off the heat and pour in your diluted vinegar.
Stir it three or four times in one direction only, and then *stop stirring*.
Let it cool for fifteen minutes, and it'll form a jelly.

Pour off the jelly into a 13"x9" pan that was lined with clean triple-layer
cheesecloth.  Get a piece of wood that's just a little smaller than the pan,
or another pan that fits just over it.  Put in a gallon jug filled with water
to press down on the jelly.  Let it set for... uhh, awhile (I forget now).
It will make 8 3"x3" cubes.  Make sure you change the water every day, and it
will keep for two weeks.  Forget to change the water and it's dead in 48
hours.
