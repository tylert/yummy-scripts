How do you remove the scent of a skunk?

I've tried tomato juice and it doesn't seem to work in getting rid of the
spray of a skunk, how do you go about getting the smell of skunk spray out of
your pet?

Contrary to popular opinion, using tomato juice is just a myth when it comes
to eliminating the smell of a skunk.  All this will do is add the smell of
tomato juice to the smell of the spray, or it's chemical name butenyl. In
order to fully get the smell off yourself or your pet, use three per cent
hydrogen peroxide - about a litre of it. Mix this with a quarter cup of
sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, and add a dash of dishwasher detergent.
The dishwasher detergent will bring the butenyl to the surface, and the other
two chemicals will chemically react with the smell and destroy it.

     Recipe for ridding skunk smell:

     - 1 litre of three per cent hydrogen peroxide
     - 1/4 cup sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)
     - dash of dishwasher detergent

Mix all of these together, then wash the areas that have been sprayed.
Afterwards, wash with normal soap and water to get the chemicals off of your
pet, or yourself for that matter.
