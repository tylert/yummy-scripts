Campfire Potatoes

1 1/2 lb New Red Potatoes
1 large Onion
1 tbsp Minced Garlic
4 tbsp Butter
1-2 tbsp Worchestershire Sauce
1/8 tsp Cayenne Pepper
Salt and Pepper to taste


Slice potatoes and onion into 1/8 – 1/4″ slices.

roll up edges.

Fold packet over and roll edges to close.
Leave on medium grill for 30 minutes or in 350 oven (in a pan to avoid messes)
for 35-40 minutes.
