Overnight Oats

1/2 cup oats (50-50 large flake, spelt)
1 tsp hemp seeds
1 tsp pea protein
1/2 tsp cinnamon
some almonds
vanilla almond milk (quantity at the discretion of the individual)

Other additional ingredients may be added such as:
- raisons
- fresh or frozen fruit pieces

Add all the dry ingredients to a small mason jar.
The night before, add at least enough vanilla almond milk to wet all the dry ingredients.
Add more vanilla almond milk as desired if you prefer a more sloppy eating experience.
Close the mason jar and leave in fridge overnight.
The next morning, open the jar and eat the contents.

Optionally:  Heat everything up if you prefer warm oatmeal.
