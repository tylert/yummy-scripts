Rissotto Parmigiano

- 400 g carnaroli rice (or arborio)
- 60 g butter
- 100 g parmigiano reggiano DOP
- 2 L broth
- 60 g white onion
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- salt to taste

Chop onion finely.
Put the beef stock to boil in separate pan.
In a deep pan, place 40 g of butter, olive oil and onion.
Fry the onion until it starts to brown.
Place the rice in the pan and fry it for a minute.
Add the water until rice is just covered. Keep adding water as the rice absorbs it. Pay attention to the cooking time (16-18 min).
The final result should be a wet rice (don't let it dry too much).
Add 20 g of butter and mix it in.
Add the grated Parmigiano cheese and mix it in.
Add salt to taste.
