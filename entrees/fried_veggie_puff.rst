Mix flour with salt, baking soda & spices, and add the grated & chopped
vegetables, add sufficient water to form a very thick batter. Let it stand for
2 hours. Taste for enough salt.

Heat the oil in a deep frying pan. When oil is hot enough for frying drop a
tablespoon of the batter to the hot oil in different places in the pan, so that
it will not stick together. Do not allow to burn, fry in medium heat until
golden brown.
