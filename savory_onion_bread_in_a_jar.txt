Savory Onion Bread in a Jar

For these recipes you will need a jar that holds around 1 quart or 1.130 litres. 

Jar ingredients:
1/4 cup dehydrated onion flakes
3 1/3 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon powdered milk
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon dried sage, optional
1 envelope of yeast

Place the onion flakes in a small zip-close bag and set aside. Combine the the other ingredients, except for the yeast, into a quart jar. Add the bag of onions and the yeast to the top of the mix and close the jar. Store the mix in a cool, dry place.

An equivalent amount of bulk yeast can be substituted for the pre-packaged yeast, but if you choose to do this you'll need to keep the mix with yeast in refrigerator or freezer until ready to use.

One envelope of yeast equals 2 3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast or 2 1/2 teaspoons quick acting yeast

This mix can be used for traditional bread if you don't have a bread maker. Just mix ingredients as you would for white bread. Knead, let rise, punch down and form loaf and place in greased pan. Let rise again and bake in a 350°F oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
If you are making this for yourself at home, try using real onions, fresh sage and substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil for more intense aroma!
