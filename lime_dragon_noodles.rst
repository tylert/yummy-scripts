Lime Dragon Noodles

2 packs (3 oz. each) ramen noodles
2 tbsp sriracha
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 lime
2 tbsp butter
2 cloves garlic
2 green onions
Handful fresh cilantro

- In a small bowl stir together the sriracha, soy sauce, brown sugar, and about 1 Tbsp juice from the lime. Set the sauce aside.
- Fill a medium sauce pot with water, place a lid on top, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, add the ramen noodles (without the flavoring packet) and continue to boil until the noodles are tender. Drain the noodles in a colander.
- While waiting for the water to boil, mince two cloves of garlic. Add the butter and garlic to a large skillet and saut√© over medium heat until the garlic is soft (about one minute). Remove the skillet from the heat.
- Once the noodles have drained, add them to the skillet, then pour the prepared sauce over top. Toss the noodles in the sauce until everything is coated in sauce. Top the dragon noodles with sliced green onion, fresh cilantro leaves, and a squeeze of lime.
