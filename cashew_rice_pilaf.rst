Cashew Rice Pilaf

2 tbsp butter
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp cinnamon
2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
1/2 cup chopped cashews
1/4 cup dried fruit raisins, cranberries or chopped apricots
3 cups water
3/4 tsp salt
1 whole bay leaf
1/4 bunch cilantro (optional)


- Place the butter, minced garlic, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon in a medium sauce pot. Turn the heat on to medium-low, then stir and cook the butter and spices for about 2 minutes.
- Add the dry rice, turn the heat up to medium, and cook and stir for about two minutes more. You should hear the rice crackling a little. Finally, add the cashews, dried fruit, water, salt, and bay leaf to the pot. Stir briefly to combine the ingredients.
- Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and allow the pot to come to a full boil. As soon as the pot reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and allow the pot to simmer lightly for 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and allow it to sit for 15 minutes more. Do not remove the lid at all during the cooking process.
- After the pot has rested with the heat off for 15 minutes, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork. Roughly chop the cilantro and gently stir it into the rice. Serve hot.
