Bagels
 
1 cup flour
1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup of greek yogurt
1 egg (for egg wash)
bagel seasoning of your choice


Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine flour, baking powder and salt together, mix in geek yogurt until a dough starts to form.
Turn dough on a lightly floured surface and brush your hands with a bit of flour.
Knead and divide into 4 parts.
Roll out each dough ball to form a rope and pinch the ends of each rope together to make a circle. You will have four bagels.
Boil for 30 seconds on each side.
Beat one egg and brush over the bagels and sprinkle with bagel seasoning of your choice.
Bake at 350 degrees for 23 minutes and 500 degrees for 2 minutes so the tops can brown.
