Homemade Bagels Recipe
----------------------

* 1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water (between 100-110°F, 38-43°C)
* 2 and 3/4 teaspoons instant or active dry yeast*
* 4 cups (520g) bread flour (spoon & leveled), plus more for work surface and hands*
* 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar or packed light or dark brown sugar (or barley malt syrup)*
* 2 teaspoons salt

* coating the bowl: nonstick spray or 2 teaspoons olive oil
* egg wash: 1 egg white beaten with 1 Tablespoon water

For Boiling

* 2 quarts water
* 1/4 cup (60g) honey (or barley malt syrup)*

Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your
stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5
minutes.

Add the flour, brown sugar, and salt. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The
dough is very stiff and will look somewhat dry.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands,
knead the dough for 4-5 minutes. The dough is too heavy for the mixer to knead
it!

Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the
bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum
foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.  Allow the dough to rise at room
temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.

Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

Shape the bagels: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air
bubbles. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it– doesn’t need
to be perfect!) Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index finger through
the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5 – 2 inches in diameter. Watch
video above for a visual. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with kitchen towel
and rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.

Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).

Water bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. Whisk in the honey.
Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop bagels in, 2-4 at
a time, making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels for
1 minute on each side.

Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each
bagel. Place 4 bagels onto each lined baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes,
rotating the pan halfway through. You want the bagels to be a dark golden
brown. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool on the baking sheets for
20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
