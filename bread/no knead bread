OMFG Delicious No Knead Bread
(5 out of 5 thumbs up.  30 Helens agree that this is the best bread.)

3 cups all purpose flour
1/4 tsp dry active yeast (I use quick rise)
3/4 tsp salt
1.5 cups hot water (not boiling)

Mix flour, yeast and salt in large mixing bowl.
Stir in hot water until throughly mixed (don't over work).
Cover bowl with platic wrap (or another non-absorbent material).
Let dough sit between 3 and 16 hours.
Turn dough out onto well floured surface.
With pastry scraper, fold dough 10-12 times, quickly shape into ball.
Put dough ball on parchment paper in clean bowl, let rise for 35 minutes.
While the dough is rising, put empty dutch oven or casserole dish in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees. (you may have to play with the tempurature a bit, mine is only 425.  450 overcooked the bread)
When oven is preheated, carefully put the parchment and bread in the dutch oven or casserole dish and put the lid back on.
Bake for 30 minutes.  Then remove the lid and parchment and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes to brown to desired darkness.
Let cool at least 15 minutes before slicing.
