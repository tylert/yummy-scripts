Place indregients int the bread pan using the least amount of liquid liste in
the recipe.  Select medium crust setting and press start.

Observer the dough as it kneads.  After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry and
stiff or if your machine sounds as if it is straning to knead it, add more
liquid 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough forms a smooth, pliable ball that
it slightly tacky to the touch.

After the baking cycle ends, remove bread form the pan, place on cooling rack
and allow to cool for 1 hour before slicing.
