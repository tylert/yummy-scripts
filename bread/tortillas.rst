Tortillas
---------

* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil or other fairly neutral flavored oil
* 1 cup warm water

Combine flour, salt and baking powder in a medium or large bowl, mix until well
combined.

Add oil and water with mixer running at a medium speed. After about 1 minute,
or when mixture comes together and begins to form a ball, decrease mixing speed
to low. Continue to mix for 1 minute or until dough is smooth.

Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 16 equal
portions. Turn each piece to coat with flour. Form each piece into a ball and
flatten with the palm of your hand. Cover flattened balls of dough with a clean
kitchen towel and allow to rest for at least 15 minutes (or as much as 2 hours)
before proceeding.

Roll out dough balls until 1/8 thick and fry and enjoy.
