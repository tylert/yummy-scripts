Jalapeno Cheddar Cornbread
--------------------------

* 2 jalapenos
* 1 1/2 cups cheddar, shredded
* 1 cup grape tomatoes
* 1 cup cornmeal
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup milk
* 1 large egg
* 1/4 cup cooking oil


Preheat the oven to 425oF. Shred the cheddar cheese, if not purchased
pre-shredded. Slice one of the jalapenos length-wise, scrape out the seeds,
then dice into 1/4-inch pieces. Slice the second jalapeno into rounds, leaving
the seeds intact. Slice the grape tomatoes in half.

Add the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl.
Stir until they are well combined.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and cooking oil.

Pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just
until a lumpy batter forms and no more dry flour remains on the bottom of the
bowl. Do not over stir.

Add 1 cup of the cheddar cheese and the diced jalapenos to the batter and
gently fold until they are incorporated. Prepare a 8x8" casserole dish, a 9"
pie plate, or a 10" cast-iron skillet by coating with non-stick spray or a
smear of butter. Pour the batter into the dish. Sprinkle the tomato halves, the
sliced jalapeno, and the remaining shredded cheddar over the top.

Bake the cornbread for 18-20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the
center is puffed up and the cheese on top is deep golden brown. Let cool for
about 5 minutes, then slice into 8 pieces and serve.
