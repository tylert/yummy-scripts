Jalapeno Cheddar Cornbread

2 jalapenos
1.5 cups cheddar, shredded
1 cup grape tomatoes
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp sugar
4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup milk
1 large egg
1/4 cup cooking oil


1. Preheat the oven to 425oF. Shred the cheddar cheese, if not purchased pre-shredded. Slice one of the jalapenos length-wise, scrape out the seeds, then dice into 1/4-inch pieces. Slice the second jalapeno into rounds, leaving the seeds intact. Slice the grape tomatoes in half.
2. Add the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl. Stir until they are well combined.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and cooking oil.
4. Pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until a lumpy batter forms and no more dry flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. Do not over stir.
5. Add 1 cup of the cheddar cheese and the diced jalapenos to the batter and gently fold until they are incorporated. Prepare a 8x8" casserole dish, a 9" pie plate, or a 10" cast-iron skillet by coating with non-stick spray or a smear of butter. Pour the batter into the dish. Sprinkle the tomato halves, the sliced jalapeno, and the remaining shredded cheddar over the top.
6. Bake the cornbread for 18-20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the center is puffed up and the cheese on top is deep golden brown. Let cool for about 5 minutes, then slice into 8 pieces and serve.
