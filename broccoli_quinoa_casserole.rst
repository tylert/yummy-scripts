Cheesy Broccoli Quinoa Casserole

1 1/2 cups quinoa, uncooked
2 crowns of broccoli, cut into small florets
3 Tbsp butter
3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 cups milk (I use 2%)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 Tbsp spicy brown mustard (I use Creole)
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper, to taste
8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Preheat oven to 400.
In a medium sauce pan, cook the quinoa in water with a generous pinch of salt, according to package, directions and then set aside.
In a large pot, add the broccoli and a couple of inches of water.
Cover the pot, bring to a boil for 1-2 minutes, and then drain and rinse with cold water.
Return the drained broccoli to the large pot and add the quinoa.
In a saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter.
Whisk in the flour, onion, garlic, mustard, cayenne, a generous pinch of salt and black pepper.
Let cook 1-2 minutes and then slowly add the milk, whisking until the sauce is smooth.
Let the sauce simmer, reducing the heat if necessary, about 5 minutes until thickened and bubbling.
Remove from heat, whisk in the cheddar a handful at a time until completely melted.
Salt and pepper to taste.
Pour sauce over broccoli-quinoa mixture and toss to coat, mixing well.
Rransfer mixture to a casserole dish and bake 35-30 minutes, until the top is nicely browned.
Serve warm.
