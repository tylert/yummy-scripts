Dill Pickle Soup

Servings: Serves 6-8

Ingredients

5-1/2 cups veggie broth
1-3/4 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 cups chopped carrots (smaller dice)
1 cup chopped dill pickles (smaller dice ~ about 3 large whole dills)
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup water
2 cups dill pickle juice*
1-1/2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Garnish (optional)

sliced dill pickles
fresh dill
black pepper

Directions

In a large pot, combine broth, potatoes, carrots and butter. Bring to a boil
and cook until the potatoes are tender. Add pickles and continue to boil.

In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sour cream and water, making a paste.
Vigorously whisk sour cream mixture (2 Tablespoons at a time) into soup. (This
will also break up some of your potatoes which is okay. You might see some
initial little balls of flour form, but between the whisking and boiling all
will disappear. Don't panic.)

Add pickle juice, Old Bay, salt (*see below), pepper and cayenne. Cook 5 more
minutes and remove from heat. Serve immediately.

*All pickle juice is not created equal. Some is saltier than others. Taste your
soup after adding the pickle juice and final seasonings. It's possible you will
not need any salt or would prefer more or less.
