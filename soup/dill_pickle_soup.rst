Dill Pickle Soup

Servings: Serves 6-8

Ingredients

    5-1/2 cups veggie broth
    1-3/4 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
    2 cups chopped carrots (smaller dice)
    1 cup chopped dill pickles (smaller dice ~ about 3 large whole dills)
    1/2 cup unsalted butter
    1/2 cup all-purpose flour
    1 cup sour cream
    1/4 cup water
    2 cups dill pickle juice*
    1-1/2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning
    1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
    1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Garnish (optional)

    sliced dill pickles
    fresh dill
    black pepper

Directions

    In a large pot, combine broth, potatoes, carrots and butter. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender. Add pickles and continue to boil.
    In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sour cream and water, making a paste. Vigorously whisk sour cream mixture (2 Tablespoons at a time) into soup. (This will also break up some of your potatoes which is okay. You might see some initial little balls of flour form, but between the whisking and boiling all will disappear. Don't panic.)
    Add pickle juice, Old Bay, salt (*see below), pepper and cayenne. Cook 5 more minutes and remove from heat. Serve immediately.
    *All pickle juice is not created equal. Some is saltier than others. Taste your soup after adding the pickle juice and final seasonings. It's possible you will not need any salt or would prefer more or less.
