Potato and Leek Soup


1/4 cup olive oil
1 large brown onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, crushed
4 celery sticks, sliced
2 leeks, white part only, sliced
6 medium potatoes , peeled and diced
8 cups vegetable stock
sea salt and freshly ground pepper, to season
6 slices day old bread, torn for croutons
2 tablespoon chopped chives


HEAT one tablespoon of the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until the onion is soft and transparent.

ADD the leeks and cook, stirring, for a further 5 minutes until leeks soften. Do not allow the leeks or onions to brown.

ADD the celery and potato and cook, stirring for a further 5 minutes, until potato begins to soften a little.

ADD the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium and gently boil, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until potato is cooked. Remove from heat and set aside for 10 minutes to cool.

MEANWHILE, preheat oven to 180°C. Place bread in a roasting pan. Drizzle with remaining oil and a generous sprinkling of sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Toss until bread is evenly coated. Toast in preheated oven, shaking pan occasionally, for 10 minutes or until crisp. Remove croutons from oven and set aside.

PUREE soup in batches in the jug of a blender or in the pot with a hand-held immersion stick blender.

REHEAT soup just before serving.  Check seasoning. Ladle the soup among serving bowls. Top with croutons and sprinkle with chives. Serve immediately.
