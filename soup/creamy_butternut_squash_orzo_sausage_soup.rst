Creamy Butternut Squash Orzo with Sausage
-----------------------------------------

* 3 chipotle veggie sausages
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup veggie broth
* 1 cup butternut squash puree
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 10 oz orzo uncooked
* 2 tablespoons fresh sage chopped
* 2 tablespoons fresh thyme

In large skillet add heavy cream, chicken stock, butternut squash puree, and
minced garlic.

Bring the sauce to a boil on medium heat, reduce to low-medium heat, stir
everything well. Cook for about 5 or more minutes. Make sure the garlic is
cooked to your liking, and the sauce thickens. Cook longer if you would like a
thicker sauce. Remove from heat.

While the sauce cooks for 5 or more minutes, cook the orzo as described below.

Cook orzo according to package instructions. In my case, I cooked orzo al dente
for 7 minutes in a pot of boiling water. Remove from heat. Drain but do not
rinse.

Add cooked orzo to the skillet with creamy butternut squash and sausage. Stir
in half of the fresh sage and half of the fresh thyme, add sausage slices.

Cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
