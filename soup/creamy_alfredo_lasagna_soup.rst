Creamy Alfredo Lasagna Soup
---------------------------

* 1/2 lb vegan sausage
* 1 small onion chopped
* 8 ounces mushrooms sliced
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 4 cups baby spinach
* 5 cups low sodium veggie broth
* 5 lasagna noodles broken or mini lasagna noodles
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup Parmesan grated

Warm sausage in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and mushrooms;
cook 5-6 minutes over medium-low heat.

Add garlic and spinach and cook for 1 minute while stirring.

Add veggie broth and simmer for 5 minutes.

Add broken lasagna noodles, oregano and basil and bring to a low boil.

Cook for 10-12 minutes or until the noodles are tender.

Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter. Whisk in flour and
continue cooking for 1 minute; whisking constantly. The butter/flour mixture
should be bubbling.

Slowly whisk in milk until mixture is smooth and thickened; about 3-5
minutes.

Turn off heat and slowly whisk in Parmesan cheese. If cheese is not melting
place over very low heat and whisk constantly. When Parmesan is fully melted
and mixture is creamy, slowly add to soup mixture whisking in.
