Creamy Sausage Tortellini Soup
------------------------------

* 1 lb spicy sausage (fieldroast chipotle is good)
* 1 small yellow onion diced
* 1 small shallot diced
* 2 large carrots peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic minced
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 veggie bullion cubes
* 5 cup water
* 14 oz refrigerated cheese tortellini
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
* 6 oz fresh spinach chopped
* 2 cup half and half or heavy cream

Add onion, shallot and carrot, sauté for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are
soft. Add the garlic and sauté for an additional 2 minutes, or until fragrant,
stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning.

Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually add in the chicken broth,
whisk to combine. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer, then
reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 6 minutes.

Add the sausage along with the tortellini, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning,
spinach, and half & half. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until the tortellini is
fully cooked.

Serve immediately with freshly grated parmesan, if desired.
