Golden Coconut Lentil Soup

1 tbsp olive oil
1 yellow onion
2 cloves garlic
1 inch fresh ginger
1/2 tbsp ground turmeric
Pinch red pepper flakes
2-3 carrots
1 cup red or yellow lentils
4 cups water
13.5 oz can coconut milk
1/2 tbsp salt

TOPPINGS (OPTIONAL)
1/3 cup large, unsweetened coconut flakes
1/4 bunch cilantro
2 cups cooked jasmine rice

- Add the olive oil to a large pot. Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate
  or mince the ginger (I use a small-holed cheese grater). Sauté the onion,
garlic, and ginger in the olive oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until
the onions are soft and transparent. While the onions, garlic, and ginger are
sautéing, peel and slice the carrots.

- Add the turmeric and red pepper to the pot and sauté for a minute more. Add
  the carrots to the pot, sauté for a minute more, then add the lentils and
water. Place a lid on the pot, bring it up to a boil over high heat, then turn
the heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.

- Toast the coconut flakes while the soup simmers. Add the coconut flakes to a
  dry skillet and place it over medium-low heat. Stir continuously as the
flakes heat until they are about 50% golden brown (1-3 minutes). Remove the
flakes from the hot skillet immediately to stop the toasting process.

- After 20 minutes the lentils should be soft and broken down. Stir the coconut
  milk into the soup. Use an immersion blender or carefully blend the warm soup
in small batches until about half of the soup is puréed (or all of it if you
want it completely smooth). Once blended, begin adding salt, 1/2 tsp at a time,
until the soup is properly seasoned. I used 1.5 tsp or 1/2 Tbsp of salt. Also
adjust the red pepper flakes, if desired.

- To serve the soup, ladle about 1.5 cups into a bowl and top with 1/2 cup
  cooked rice, some fresh cilantro leaves, and a sprinkle of toasted coconut
flakes.
