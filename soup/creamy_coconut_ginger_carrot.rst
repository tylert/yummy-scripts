2 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp coriander

In a large saucepan, cook the onion and garlic in either a bit of olive oil, vegetable stock or water for 3-4 minutes.
Add the ginger and carrot and continue stirring.
Stir in the spices and cook for a few more minutes.
Add the coconut milk and vegetable broth and let simmer lightly, uncovered for about 20-25 minutes or until
