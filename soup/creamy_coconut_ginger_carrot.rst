 Vegan Creamy Coconut Ginger Carrot Soup

1 white onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp coriander
5 cups peeled and chopped carrots (approx. 7 large carrots)
3 cups vegetable stock
1 cup coconut milk
salt and pepper to taste


In a large saucepan, cook the onion and garlic in either a bit of olive oil,
vegetable stock or water for 3-4 minutes.

Add the ginger and carrot and continue stirring.
Stir in the spices and cook for a few more minutes.

Add the coconut milk and vegetable broth and let simmer lightly, uncovered for
about 20-25 minutes or until the carrots are cooked through.

Either using an immersion blender or by placing the soup in a blender or food
processor, puree until smooth and creamy.

If needed, add additional salt and pepper to taste and serve.
Optional: serve with diced green onion, fresh cilantro and fresh lime.
