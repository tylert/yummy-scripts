Panera Garden Vegetable Soup with Pesto Recipe

Yield: Serves 6 to 8

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 60 minutes

Ingredients:

6 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup pearled barley
2 Tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, peeled and diced (about 3/4 cup)
1/2 red pepper, diced (about 1/2 cup)
6 large garlic cloves, minced
1/2 head of cauliflower, cut into florets (about 2 cups)
8 ounces wax beans or green beans, trimmed and chopped into bite-sized pieces (about 1 3/4 cups)
16 ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
28 ounce can diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 large swiss chard stems, remove stems and chop (about 2 cups)
2 small zucchini, diced (about 2 1/2 cups)
store-bought or homemade pesto (optional, for serving)

Directions:

In a heavy bottom Dutch oven, add 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth and 1/2 cup
pearled barley. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, reduce
heat and allow the pearl barley to simmer at least 10 minutes. Check it often
and stir as the broth will evaporate. Once the barley has reached its desired
chewiness, it’s done cooking. Fluff with a fork and scoop the barley into a
clean bowl. Set aside.

Add olive oil to the Dutch oven and heat high on medium for 2 minutes. Add
onion and red pepper, cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally with a
rubber spatula. Add garlic and cook for 90 seconds. Add cauliflower, beans and
chickpeas. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and the remaining
vegetable broth and 1 1/2 to 2 cups water. Add thyme, oregano, onion powder,
garlic powder, salt and pepper and stir. Bring soup to a boil.

Once soup comes to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Add swiss
chard, zucchini and cooked barley. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring to
combine. Season with salt and pepper, if necessary.

Portion soup to serving bowls and serve with a scoop of pesto on top of each
bowl.
