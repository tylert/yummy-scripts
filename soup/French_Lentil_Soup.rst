French Lentil Soup

Makes 6 servings


Ingredients

    3 tablespoons extra–virgin olive oil
    2 cups chopped onions
    1 cup chopped celery stalks plus chopped celery leaves for garnish
    1 cup chopped carrots
    2 garlic cloves, chopped
    4 cups (or more) vegetable broth
    1 1/4 cups lentils, rinsed, drained
    1 14 1/2–ounce can diced tomatoes in juice
    Balsamic vinegar (optional)

Preparation

Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium–high heat. Add onions, celery, carrots, and garlic; sauté until vegetables begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Add 4 cups broth, lentils, and tomatoes with juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium–low, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes.

Transfer 2 cups soup (mostly solids) to blender and puree until smooth. Return puree to soup in pan; thin soup with more broth by 1/4 cupfuls, if too thick. Season with salt, pepper, and a splash of vinegar, if desired. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with celery leaves.
