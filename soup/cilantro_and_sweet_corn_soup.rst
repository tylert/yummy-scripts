Cilantro and Sweet Corn Soup

Ingredients

2 Tbs olive oil (or your favorite cooking oil)
1 tsp chili powder
1/8 - 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp cumin
1 onion, chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, chopped
4 c fresh or frozen corn kernels
1 poblano pepper, chopped
2 roma tomatoes, squeezed and chopped
2 c unsweetened almond milk
1/2 tsp salt
juice of 1 lime
black pepper to taste
1 tsp agave or maple syrup
1/2 c water
1 c cilantro leaves, loosely packed

Instructions

    Heat the oil on low in a large nonstick cooking pot. Add the chili powder, red pepper flakes and cumin and let bloom about 5 minutes. While that's happening, chop the onion.
    Raise the heat to medium and add the onion. Cook, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Chop the garlic as the onion cooks.
    Add the garlic and saute 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat if the garlic starts to burn.
    Add the corn and saute 5 minutes. If you're using frozen corn, add it frozen. Chop the poblano and tomatoes while the corn cooks.
    Remove about a cup of the mixture to a food processor.
    Add the poblano and tomatoes to the cooking pot. Reduce the heat to medium low and stir occasionally.
    Process the corn mixture in the food processor about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the almond milk and process until smooth. Add it to the cooking pot.
    Stir in the other cup of milk, salt, lime juice, pepper, sweetener and water. Simmer 5-10 minutes to heat through. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.
    Stir in the cilantro leaves just before serving.
