Potato Samosa Phyllo Triangles

1 1/2 pound Yukon Gold or boiling potatoes
1 large onion, chopped (2 3/4 cups)
1 teaspoon garam masala (Indian spice blend)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
12 (17- by 12-inch) phyllo sheets, thawed if frozen
3/4 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled

Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Put in a medium saucepan with 1
teaspoon salt and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Simmer until tender, about
15 minutes, then drain in a colander.

Cook onion, spices, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet
over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 8 to 10
minutes. Add potatoes and peas and cook, stirring, 3 minutes, then remove from
heat and cool slightly.

Preheat oven to 375Â°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.

Cover stack of phyllo sheets with plastic wrap and a damp kitchen towel.
Keeping remaining phyllo covered and working quickly, place 1 sheet on work
surface. Gently brush with some butter, then lay a second sheet on top and
brush with butter. Cut crosswise into 4 strips. Put 2 tablespoons filling near
one corner of 1 strip and fold corner of phyllo over to enclose filling and
form a triangle. Continue folding strip, maintaining triangle shape. Put
samosa, seam side down, on baking sheet. Make 3 more triangles in same manner.
Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling. Generously brush both sides of each
samosa with butter and bake, turning samosas over halfway through and switching
position of sheets, until golden and crisp all over, about 25 minutes total.
Cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.
