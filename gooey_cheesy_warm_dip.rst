Gooey and Cheesy Warm Dip
 
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 cups sour cream (I used light)
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 cup sliced green onion


Preheat oven to 400 F.
Combine softened cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar cheese, bacon and green onion

Spoon mixture into a 1-quart baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until
cheese is bubbling and hot.

Serve with bread slices, crackers, or veggies.
