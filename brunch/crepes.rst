Crepes
------

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

- Whisk together the flour and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the milk
  and water gradually to combine. Beat in the salt and butter until smooth.

- Over medium-high heat, heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan. Pour or
  spoon the batter onto the griddle, about 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan
  in a circular motion to evenly coat the surface with batter.

- Cook for 2 minutes, or until the bottom is light brown. Turn and cook the
  other side after loosening with a spatula. Serve immediately.
