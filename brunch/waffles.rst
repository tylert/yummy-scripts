Waffles

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 tbsp cinnamon
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (or any vegan oil substitute - I use olive oil)
2 cups milk (or any vegan dairy subtitute)


Preheat the waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In one medium bowl sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Set aside.

In a second bowl the vanilla extract, melted butter and milk, whisk to combine.  Combine the milk mixture with the flour mixture and whisk just until blended.  Do not over mix.  

Pour enough batter in iron to just cover waffle grid.  Close and cook as per manufacturer's instructions until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Note: I usually double the recipe and freeze the waffles.  Defrost in fridge overnight and reheat in toaster, watching not to over toast them.
