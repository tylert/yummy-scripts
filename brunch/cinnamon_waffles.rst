Cinnamon Waffles
----------------

* 4 cups flour
* 4 teaspoon baking powder
* 4 tablespoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 4 tablespoons melted butter (or oil of your choice)
* 4 cups vanilla almond milk (or milk of your choice)

In a large bowl combine all dry ingredients.

In a medium bowl combine all wet ingredients and whisk to disperse the butter
(oil), then pour over the wet ingredients and mix until all dry ingredients are
combined.

Follow waffle maker instructions for cooking time.

This is a double batch, so spliting it in half will work pefectly. The double
batch makes 12-13 rectangle 6x4 waffles.

They freeze really well, so you will have future breakfasts in a few minutes.
Let them cool completely then put into a freezer safe container or plastic bag.
Simply remove from the freezer and reheat them in the toaster or defrost
overnight and toast the next morning.
