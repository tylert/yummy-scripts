Creamy Scalloped Potatoes

1 small cooking onion
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp flour
1 1/2 cups of milk
3 medium potatoes
Salt & pepper to taste

In microwave safe glass casserole dish add onion, butter, salt and pepper.
Heat in microwave for 2 minutes then stir onions and butter until evenly
distributed Add flour, mix until no dry flour is visible.  Add milk, mix well.
Microwave on high in 4 minutes intervals, mixing after each... until sauce is
thick. (approx 12 minutes) Once sauce is thick add potatoes, mix to coat well.
Microwave on high in 5 minutes intervals, mixing after each... until potates
are cooked. (approx 20 minutes)

Personal notes:  This is not a low fat receipe.  Is a great side dish with meat
and veggies.  I have also added garlic to this one, usually 3-4 cloves (we love
garlic). When serving you can also sprinkle a little cheddar cheese on top...
as if it is not calories heavy enough.  :)
