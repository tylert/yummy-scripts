Lemon Risotto

2 shallots
1 rib celery
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/3 cups risotto rice, preferably Arborio or Vialone Nano
Approximately 1 quart vegetable stock
1/2 unwaxed lemon, zested and juiced
Needles from 2 small sprigs fresh rosemary, finely chopped
1 egg yolk
4 tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more, for garnish
4 tablespoons heavy cream
Good grating black pepper, preferably white
Maldon or other sea salt, to taste

Put the shallots and celery into a mini food processor and blitz
until they are finely chopped. Heat half the butter, the oil and the
shallot and celery mixture in a wide saucepan, and cook to soften
the mixture for about 5 minutes, making sure it doesn't stick. Mix
in the rice, stirring to give it a good coating of oil and butter.
Meanwhile, heat the stock in another saucepan and keep it at the
simmering point.

Put a ladleful of the stock into the rice and keep stirring until the
stock is absorbed. Then add another ladleful and stir again.
Continue doing this until the rice is al dente. You may not need all
of the stock, equally, you may need to add hot water from the
kettle.

Mix the lemon zest and the rosemary into the risotto, and in a
small bowl beat the egg yolk, lemon juice, Parmesan, cream and
pepper.

When the risotto is ready - when the rice is no longer chalky, but
still has some bite - take it off the heat and add the bowl of eggy,
lemony mixture, and the remaining butter and salt, to taste.
Serve with more Parmesan if you wish, check the seasoning and
dive in.
