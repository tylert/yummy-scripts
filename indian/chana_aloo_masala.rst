Chana Aloo Masala (Chickpea and Potato Masala)
----------------------------------------------

* 1 lb russet potato
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 yellow onion
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 Tbsp fresh grated ginger
* 1 Tbsp garam masala (or to taste)
* 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
* 2 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)
* 15 oz can chickpeas
* 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro (optional)
* 6 oz plain yogurt (optional)
* 4 cups cooked rice (optional)

Peel the potato and cut it into one-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a sauce
pot, add enough water to cover the potatoes by one inch, and bring the pot to
a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes for 5-7 minutes, or until they can
easily be pierced with a fork. Drain the potatoes and set them aside.

Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and peel and grate the ginger (use a
small-holed cheese grater). Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, and ginger to a
large deep skillet and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and
transparent (3-5 minutes).

Add the garam masala to the skillet and continue to sauté for about a minute
more to toast the spices. It's okay if the spices begin to stick to the
surface of the skillet slightly, but be sure not to let them burn.

Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste to the skillet. Stir to dissolve
the tomato paste into the crushed tomatoes and to dissolve the spices off the
bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to heat through (about five minutes).
Taste the sauce and add salt as needed (I added 1/2 tsp salt).

Drain the chickpeas, then add them to the skillet along with the cooked
potatoes. Stir everything to coat in the hot sauce, then heat through. Spoon
the Chana Aloo Masala over cooked rice (or serve with naan), topped with
chopped cilantro and a dollop of plain yogurt (regular or Greek style).
