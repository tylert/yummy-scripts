Chickpea, Spinach & Mushroom Curry
----------------------------------

* 1 small onion finely chopped
* 8 oz. mushrooms sliced or quartered
* 1 tbsp oil
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp curry powder
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1-2 tsp coriander
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 cups sliced tomatoes
* 1/4 cup marinara or tomato puree
* 1 15 oz. can coconut milk
* 1 15 oz. can chickpeas
* 2 cups baby spinach
* Cilantro and red chili flakes for serving

Add onions and oil to pan, cook for 3 min. While those are cooking, you can cut
the mushrooms and add to pan. Cook another 7 min, stir occasionally and add
some water to prevent burning if needed.

Add spices, tomato paste and sliced tomatoes. Cook 2 min, stirring. Then add
remaining ingredients except the baby spinach. For the coriander, you can add
the 1 tsp and cook 5 min, taste and add another tsp for deeper flavor.

Cook at gentle simmer for 10 min, partially covered. Add spinach, stir and cook
another couple min until wilted.

Serve with chopped cilantro and red chili flakes.
