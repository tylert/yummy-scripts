Chilli Garlic Curry

Prep Time: 10 minutes
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Total Time: 20 minutes

3 tbsp rapeseed (canola) oil
8 garlic cloves, cut into thin slivers
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 tbsp garlic and ginger paste
2 (or more) fresh green chillies, sliced into thin rings, plus
extra to serve (optional)
1 tsp chilli powder
1 tbsp mixed powder or curry powder
1 tbsp tandoori masala
70ml (1/4 cup) tomato purée
300ml (1 1/4 cups) base curry sauce, heated
1 handful of dried garlic flakes (optional)
1 tsp dried fenugreek (methi) leaves
2 tbsp chopped coriander (cilantro)
Juice of one lime (optional)
Salt

Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat and add the garlic. It is very
important not to burn the garlic, so watch the pan and move the slivers around
in the pan until they become soft and are just beginning to brown.

Now add the onion and fry for about 3 minutes until soft and translucent,
sprinkling a little salt over the onions to help release moisture.

Stir in the garlic and ginger paste and chillies, and fry for about 20 seconds.
Increase the heat to medium-high, add the ground spices and tomato purée and
sizzle for a further 30 seconds, stirring continuously.

Add about a ladle or two of the base curry sauce and bring to a rolling simmer.
(You don’t need to stir the sauce unless it is obviously catching on the pan.)

Be sure to scrape any sauce that caramelises to the sides of the pan back into
the sauce. Add more base as required. If the curry is looking too dry, add more
base. If too saucy, just cook it down.

Add the pre cooked chicken and coat with the sauce

Continue simmering until fenugreek leaves and check for seasoning, adding salt
to taste.

Sprinkle with the chopped coriander (cilantro) and a few more chillies if you
like. A twist of lime juice is a nice addition.
