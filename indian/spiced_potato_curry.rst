Dry Spiced Potato Curry
-----------------------

* 500 g potatos - boiled, peeled and cubed
* A few curry leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon dil seed (uluhal)
* 1 large onion - chopped
* 1 teaspoon cumin (suduru)
* 2 teaspoons chillie pieces
* 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
* 2 tablespoons cooking oil
* 2 tablespoons desiccated coconut

Dry roast cumin, dill seed and chillie pieces for one minute in a pan, then
into the same pan, add the oil, onions, mustard seeds and curry leaves.  When
the onions are nicely browned, add the potatoes, turmeric, salt and coconut.
Stir and toss until potatoes have absorbed the spice mixture.  Sprinkle with
chopped fresh coriander leaves and serve hot.

Goes well with yellow rice, fried rice or string hoppers.
