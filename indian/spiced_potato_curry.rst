1/2 teaspoon dil seed (uluhal)
1 large onion - chopped
1 teaspoon cumin (suduru)
2 teaspoons chillie pieces
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
2 tablespoons cooking oil

Dry roast cumin, dill seed and chillie pieces for one minute in a pan, then
into the same pan, add the oil, onions, mustard seeds and curry leaves.  When
