Sri Lankan Lentils Recipe

2 cups red lentils
2 medium onions, sliced finely
2 small red chilies, seeded and chopped finely
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 teaspoons dried shrimp
1 teaspoon turmeric, ground
6 curry leaves
2 cups coconut milk
1 cup vegetable stock
1 cinnamon stick
10 cm lemon grass (white part only)

Heat a wok with the cooking oil. Saute the onion and cook over moderate heat
for 10 minutes, or until the onion is golden brown. Remove half the sauteed
onion and set aside as garnishing. Add the chili, turmeric, dried shrimp and
cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the curry leaves, lentils, vegetable stock, coconut
milk, cinnamon stick and lemon grass. Bring to the boil and simmer on reduced
heat, uncovered for 45 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick and lemon grass
before serving. Garnish with the reserved sauteed onions. Serve hot.
