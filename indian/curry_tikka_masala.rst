Tikka Masala Curry
------------------

* 3 tbsp ghee or rapeseed (canola) oil
* 1 tbsp garlic and ginger paste
* 1/2 tbsp sugar (more or less to taste)
* 1 tbsp ground almonds
* 1 tbsp coconut flour
* 70ml (1/4 cup) tomato puree
* 1 tbsp mixed powder
* 1 tbsp tandoori masala
* 1/2 - 1 tbsp paprika
* 300ml (1 1/2 cups) base curry sauce
* 100ml (scant 1/3 cup) single cream (more or less to taste
* 1 tsp red food colouring powder (optional)
* Juice of one lemon (optional)
* Salt to taste
* 1/2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi)
* 1/2 tsp garam masala
* 2 tbsp chopped coriander (cilantro) to taste

Heat the ghee/oil in a frying pan over medium high heat

When visibly hot, add the garlic and ginger paste and stir well to cook out the
rawness.

Stir in the coconut flour, sugar, ground almonds, mixed powder, tandoori masala
and paprika and again stir well.

Pour in the tomato puree and bring to a simmer. Then add about a ladle of base
curry sauce. You will need to top this up from time to time. If the curry is
looking too dry, add more base sauce. If too saucy, cook it down.

Bring this all to a bubbling simmer and then add the pre-cooked tandoori
chicken. Stir well to coat the meat with the sauce. Remember to add more base
if it is looking dry. Scrape around the edges of the pan as the base sauce
caramelises to the side. This will add a delicious flavour to your chicken
tikka masala.

Now add the food colouring if using.

Continue stirring to colour the sauce adding more of the heated curry sauce
when required

Simmer for about a minute and pour in the cream.

Stir in the fresh coriander, season with salt to taste and finish with a
squeeze of lemon the dried fenugreek and the garam masala.
