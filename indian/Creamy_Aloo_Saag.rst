Creamy Aloo Saag

INGREDIENTS: 

    Fresh Spinach - 10 oz. bag (boiled & grinded)
    Garlic - 4 cloves (roughly chopped)
    Ginger - 1 inch piece (chopped)
    Green Chillies - 2 to 3 (chopped)
    Onions - 2 small (chopped)
    Oil - 1.5 tbsp
    Cumin Seeds - 1 tsp
    Turmeric Powder - 1/2 tsp
    Potatoes - 3 small (bite size cubes)
    Tomato - 1 (chopped)
    Red Chili Powder - 1 tsp
    Coriander Powder - 3 tsp
    salt to taste
    Garam Masala - 1 tsp
    Light Sour Cream - 2 to 3 dollups
    Dry Fenugreek Leaves - 2 big spoons


DIRECTIONS:
1. Boil a pot of water. 

2. When it boils, add the spinach leaves to the boiling water.

3. Allow this to cook for 3 minutes.

4. Drain.  Set aside and allow this to cool.

5. Here is what you will need.  I actually used 4 cloves of garlic.  Chop everything up.   
 
6. Heat a pot on low-medium heat (dial #4), add oil, add cumin seeds. 
 
7. Once the cumin seeds sizzle, add the turmeric powder.  Saute for 10 seconds.

8. Add the ginger, garlic and green chillies.  Saute for 20 seconds or so.
 
9. Add the chopped onions.  Saute for 3 minutes and then add salt.  Cook for another 3-5 minutes until the onions are slightly carmelized.  Stir to avoid burning.
 
10. In the meantime, peel and chop the potatoes.  Use 3 small, I only had 2 small.

11. Once the onions are done... this is what you should have.

12. Add the potatoes.  Combine.  Lower heat to dial #3, cook this for 5 minutes.
 
13. In the meantime, chop the tomato.
 
14. Now add the tomato, salt, 1/2 tsp of red chili powder, and 2 tsp coriander powder.
15. Combine.  Cover and simmer on dial #3 for 10-15 minutes, or until the tomatoes and onions have combined into a paste. 
 
16. In the meantime, make the spinach paste.  Add the spinach to a blender or Magic Bullet.  You may need to add 2 tbsp - 4 tbsp of water to get the spinach to a smooth paste.

17. Back to the onion-tomato mixture, this is what you should have after 10-15 minutes.
 
18. Add the Spinach Puree.... YUM!  My favorite color... rich and green, can you tell I'm an Emerald Lover?  :-)  I hope my husband is reading this.

19. Combine.  Cover and allow this to simmer for 10 minutes on dial #3.

20. After 10 minutes, this is what you should have.  There should be bubbles forming around the corners. The color will be an intense dark green.

21. Check the potato, make sure it is fork tender, if it is pretty close, that is okay too.  Proceed to the next step.

22. Season with salt, 1 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp coriander powder.  Combine. 

23. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes on low (dial #3).

24. Add 2-3 dollups of LIGHT Sour Cream... I used 3.

25. Take 2 spoons of dry fenugreek leaves in your palm, rub them.

26. Add the fenugreek leaves to the spinach. Make sure the Potato is fully cooked. Turn off the stove.

27. Combine.  Wait 20 minutes before serving... this will allow the flavors to combine.  Serve with rice or roti... goes well with Onion Coriander Raita.
