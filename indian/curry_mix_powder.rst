Curry Mix Powder

3 tbsp ground cumin
3 tbsp ground coriander
4 tbsp curry powder
3 tbsp paprika
3 tbsp ground turmeric
1 tbsp garam masala

Mix all the ingredients together, store in an airtight container in a cool,
dark place, and use as needed.

If you are using fresh, homemade garam masala and curry powder in your blend,
your mixed powder should last for up to 2 months without losing much flavour.
