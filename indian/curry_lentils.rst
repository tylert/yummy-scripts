Lentil Curry

Ingredients
1 1/2 - 2 cups Lentils
Water (measure with finger)
4-5 garlic
1 tsp turmeric powder
Oil
10-12 curry leaves
1/2  onion
3 green chillis
2 red dry chillis
Salt to taste
Spices (long and small Cumin Seeds, Mustard and Fenugreek)
1 1/2 or 2 tbs Coconut powder
3/4 or 1 cup water (mix the maggi powder in a hot water)

Wash lentils well with water. Add into a pan with water, garlic and turmeric
powder.  **Do not add salt yet. Boil on medium high heat until water is cooked
out and lentils are very soft (10-20 minutes).  If you need more water to get
the correct consistency add it as needed.

In a separate frying pan heat 2-3 Tbs of oil on medium heat.  Add onions, curry
leaves, green chilies, red dried chili and spices.  Fry while stirring until
onions have started to brown.

Once the lentils are cooked, add the tempering ingredients, coconut milk some
salt to taste.  And stir well.  Allow to cook for 5-8 more minutes. Serve hot
with rice or naan breads.
