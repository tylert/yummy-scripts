Creamy Eggplant Curry
---------------------

* 1 eggplant
* 2 Tbsp olive oil 30 mL
* 1 shallot finely chopped, about 1/2 cup
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 2 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp each cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, salt
* 1 14-oz coconut milk 400 g
* 1 14-oz can diced tomatoes 400 g

Eggplant: Cut the eggplant into bite-sized cubes. Heat oil in a large pot or
pan, then add cubed eggplant. Cook until eggplant begins to brown and become
soft, about 5 minutes.

Flavor: Add the shallot and garlic to the pan, continuing to cook until shallot
is soft and fragrant, another 2 minutes.

Spices: Stir in garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, and salt to evenly
coat the eggplant.

Cans: Add the can of coconut milk and (undrained) diced tomatoes. Bring to a
gentle simmer, cover, and let cook for 15 minutes.

Serve: Serve warm over rice, topped with fresh cilantro.
