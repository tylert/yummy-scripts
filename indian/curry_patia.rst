* 2 tbsp rapeseed (canola) oil
* 1/2 onion, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp garlic and ginger paste
* 1 tbsp mixed powder
* 1 tsp red chilli powder (more or less to taste)
* 1 tbsp sugar (more or less to taste)
* 70ml (1/4 cup) tomato puree

Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir in the
chopped onion and fry for about 3 to 5 minutes or until soft.

Add the garlic and ginger paste and stir, allowing to sizzle for about 45
seconds.

Now add the mixed powder, chilli powder, and sugar and fry for a further 30
seconds.

Add the tomato puree followed by a ladle of base sauce. Continue adding a
little base as required. If the curry is looking too dry, add more base sauce.
If too saucy, just cook it down.

Stir in the pre-cooked chicken or what ever pre-cooked main ingredient you
like.

Now add the tamarind concentrate and mango chutney and stir it into the sauce.

Allow to cook down to your preferred sauce texture or add more base sauce if
necessary.
