Peach Jam without Pectin
------------------------

* 2 lbs (1100 g) peach
* 1 1/2 cups sugar (use 1 1/4 cup for low sugar jam)
* 2 tablespoon lemon juice

Keep 2 plates in freezer for cold-plate test.

To peel, peaches bring a large pot of water to boil. Add peaches and boil for
1-2 minutes. Then transfer to cold water. Peel skin easily off the flesh.
Deseed the peaches and chop them roughly. Pro tip: You can peel peaches with a
knife. Skinning peaches is optional, you simply chop peaches with skin too if
blending the jam.

Transfer all ingredients to a thick bottomed and wide-based pot. Combine and
rest for 4 hours or overnight in the fridge (macerate). This resting step is
optional but helps the better setting of the jam.

Cook for 15-20 minutes on medium flame until soft.

Then mash peaches with a potato masher. Cook further on slow heat for about ten
minutes until thick. Protip: you can blend peaches and add cinnamon or vanilla
too for more flavor.

To test consistency put a large drop of jam on a cold plate. Wait for 30 secs
to cool then hold the plate horizontally. If the jam is flowing through the
plate immediately continue cooking for 5 more minutes. And if it sets then stop
cooking. Jam is ready.

Then ladle the hot jam to clean dry jars. Let the jam cool completely to room
temperature then place the lids. Store jam in the fridge or freezer. See notes
for storage and sterilization instructions.
