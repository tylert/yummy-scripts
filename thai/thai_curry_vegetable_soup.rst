Thai Curry Vegetable Soup
-------------------------

* 2 Tbsp neutral cooking oil
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 Tbsp grated fresh ginger
* 2 Tbsp Thai red curry paste
* 1 small sweet potato (about 1 lb.)
* 1 bunch baby bok choy
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 1 13oz. can coconut milk
* 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar
* 3.5 oz. rice vermicelli noodles

GARNISHES (optional)

* 1/2 red onion
* 1 lime
* 1 handful fresh cilantro
* Sriracha to taste

Prepare the vegetables for the soup and garnishes first, so they're ready to go
when needed. Mince the garlic and grate the ginger using a small-holed cheese
grater. Peel and dice the sweet potato into one-inch cubes. Wash the bok choy
well, then chop into one-inch strips, separating the fibrous stalks from the
delicate green ends. Thinly slice the red onion and roughly chop the cilantro.

Add the cooking oil to a large soup pot along with the minced garlic, grated
ginger, and Thai red curry paste. Saut√© the garlic, ginger, and curry paste
over medium heat for 1-2 minutes.

Add the diced sweet potato and chopped bok choy stalks to the pot (save the
leafy green ends for later) along with the vegetable broth. Bring the pot to a
boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 5-7
minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.

While the soup is simmering, bring a small pot of water to a boil for the
vermicelli. Once boiling, add the vermicelli and boil for 2-3 minutes, or just
until tender. Drain the rice noodles in a colander and set aside.

Once the sweet potatoes are tender, add the coconut milk and brown sugar to the
soup. Stir, taste, and adjust the fish sauce or brown sugar if needed.
Finally, add the bok choy greens and let them wilt in the hot soup.

To serve, divide the rice vermicelli among four bowls. Ladle the soup and
vegetables over the noodles, then top with red onion, cilantro, a wedge or two
of lime, and a drizzle of sriracha.
