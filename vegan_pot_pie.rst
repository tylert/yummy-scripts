Vegan Pot Pie

A comfort food classic, made vegan! Vegan Pot Pie is ready in about an hour,
and makes a delicious main dish for any holiday. I suggest making the pie
crusts ahead of time, or use store bought vegan pie crusts to make this even
easier!

Servings: 8 servings

Ingredients

    2 tablespoons olive oil
    1 small onion, chopped
    3 garlic cloves, minced
    1/3 cup all purpose flour
    2 cups vegetable broth
    1 cup unsweetened almond milk
    3 cups frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, green beans, peas)
    1 large russet potato, chopped into small chunks
    8 ounces vegan "chicken" or baked tofu, cut into chunks, optional
    1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the onions and
garlic and saute until onion is translucent, 1-2 minutes. 

Whisk in the flour, vegetable broth and unsweetened almond milk. Then add the
mixed vegetables, potato and vegan chicken or tofu, if using. Simmer for 5-10
minutes, until the sauce thickens. 

Pour the filling into the pie crust lined pan. Roll out the other pie crust on
a lightly floured surface, and carefully cover the pie with it. Trim any
overhang, and seal the edges with a fork or your fingers. Cut a few slits in
the middle of the top crust.

Bake for 45 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Cut, serve and enjoy!
