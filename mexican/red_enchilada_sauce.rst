Red Enchilada Sauce


Total Time: 20 mins
Prep Time: 5 mins
Cook Time: 15 mins

Ingredients:

2 tablespoons avocado oil (or vegetable oil, or any other neutral oil)
2 tablespoons all-purpose
4 tablespoons chili powder, (variety depends on spice level you want)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cups chicken or vegetable stock

Directions:

    Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and whisk together over the heat for one minute. Stir in the remaining seasonings (chili powder through oregano). Then gradually add in the stock, whisking constantly to remove lumps. Reduce heat and simmer 10-15 minutes until slightly thickened.
    Use immediately or refrigerate in an air-tight container for up to 3 days.  (I like to use mason jars or Weck jars to store this sauce.)
