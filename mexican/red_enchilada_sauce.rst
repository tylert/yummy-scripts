Red Enchilada Sauce
-------------------

* 2 tablespoons avocado oil (or vegetable oil, or any other neutral oil)
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose
* 4 tablespoons chili powder, (variety depends on spice level you want)
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock

Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and whisk
together over the heat for one minute. Stir in the remaining seasonings (chili
powder through oregano). Then gradually add in the stock, whisking constantly
to remove lumps. Reduce heat and simmer 10-15 minutes until slightly thickened.

Use immediately or refrigerate in an air-tight container for up to 3 days.  (I
like to use mason jars or Weck jars to store this sauce.)
