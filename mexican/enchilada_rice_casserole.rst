Enchilada Rice Casserole
------------------------

* 2 cups dry Basmati rice
* 1 cup white cheddar shredded
* 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese shredded
* 20 oz Enchilada sauce I used Old El Paso
* 16 oz refried beans I used Old El Paso
* 11 oz corn kernel drained
* cilantro for garnish
* salt and ground black pepper to taste

Cook the rice. I cooked it with 4 cups of water and 1/4 cup of butter.
Preheat oven to 350 F degrees.
Mix the 2 cheeses together.

In a large bowl mix the enchilada sauce, refried beans and half of the
cheese. Add rice, season with salt and pepper if needed, and mix well.

Pour rice mixture into a large casserole dish. Top with corn then with
remainder of cheese.

Bake for about 20 to 30 minutes or until cheese melts and is bubbly.
Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve warm.
